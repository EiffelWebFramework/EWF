# Eiffel Web Framework


## Overview

The Eiffel Web Framework (EWF) provides Eiffel users with a layer to build anything on top of the http protocol such as websites, web API/services. 

This layer is multi-platform: it can be set on Windows, Linux operating systems, and in addition it can run on top of any httpd servers such as Apache2, IIS, nginx, lighttpd. EWF includes as well a standalone httpd web server component, written in Eiffel, which enables users to run easily a web server on their machine, or even embed this component in any application written with Eiffel.

Currently EWF offers a collection of Eiffel libraries designed to be integrated with each others, and among other functionalities, it give simple access to the request data, to handle content negotiation, url dispatcher, integrate with openid system, and so on. 

There is a growing ecosystem around EWF, that provides useful components:
* OpenID and OAuth consumer library
* Various hypermedia format such as HAL, Collection+json, …
* Websocket server and client
* Template engine
* API Auto-documentation with swagger
* A simple experimental CMS.
* ...

So if you want to build a website, a web api, RESTful service, …or even if you want to consume other web api, EWF is a solution.

EWF brings with it all the advantages of the Eiffel technology and tools with its powerful features such as Design by Contract, debugging, testing tools which enable to build efficient systems expected to be repeatedly refined, extended, and improved in a predictable and controllable way so as to become with time bugfree systems. Enjoy the full power of debugging your web server application from the IDE.

## Requirements
* Compiling from EiffelStudio 13.11 to 15.05 and more recent version of the compiler.
* Currently being developped using EiffelStudio 15.01 (on Windows, Linux)
* Tested using EiffelStudio 15.01 with "jenkins" CI server (not anymore compatible with 6.8 due to use of `TABLE_ITERABLE`)
* The code have to allow __void-safe__ compilation and non void-safe system (see [more about void-safety](http://docs.eiffel.com/book/method/void-safe-programming-eiffel) )

## How to get the source code?

Using git 
* git clone https://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF.git

* And to build the required and related Clibs
  * cd contrib/ise_library/cURL
  * geant compile
