## Agenda

* Current status of EWF
 * Focus on new design for the router system, and take decision
   * decide if this replace the previous system, 
   * or if this is provided as another solution (we would then have 2 routers system).
   * It might be possible to implement the previous uri and uri-template router with the new design, and mark them obsolete, this would avoid breaking existing code, but if no-one ask for it, no need to spend time doing it.
 * Current activities
   * Technology forecasting about REST, Hypermedia API, Collection/JSON, HAL, ...
   * Building a CMS framework inspired by Drupal, and using EWF
   * Libraries in-progress or draft: OAuth (consumer), Google API, Github API, Template engine, Wikitext parser, CMS (including sub libraries which will be part of EWF, such as session handling, mailer, ...)
   * Documentation
 * Remaining issues
   * Review design in relation to concurrency, and provide example demonstrating concurrency with EWF
   * Review design to allow easier extension/customization of EWF, such as using its own MIME handlers.
 * Demo for a CMS built with EWF (inspired by Drupal)
* Future tasks
 * [graphviz-server](https://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/graphviz-server)
 * Improving Eiffel Web Nino: to support persistent connection, and better concurrency design.
 * Provide friendly components to generate HTML (DHTML, HTML5, ...), (coders do not want to learn HTML and 
CSS)
* Users feedback, suggestions and requests
 * ...
* Next meeting

## Materials

## Minutes
* swagger: see if we could generate EWF code from a swagger specification
* Jocelyn will publish its attempt to build a CMS with EWF
 * CMS demo: ... as announced ... some parts look very like drupal. 
* Jocelyn will publish a few in-progress draft libraries
* Javier will focus on graphviz-server and hypermedia API
* Berend may send a short note on how he uses EWF (and generate code from description)
* Jocelyn will try to find time to complete the thread and SCOOP implementation of Eiffel Web Nino
* Olivier will have a closer look at swagger
* EWF will adopt the new WSF_ROUTER design as no-one expressed opposition. Olivier said converting his code is not a big task. Same for other users.
* The current state of EWF/WSF seems to be ok for users, we can focus on libraries on top of EWF/WSF
* We might need an HTML parser, if we want to support HTML as an hypermedia API  (maybe we can require XHTML for now)
* No high priority to improve Eiffel Web Nino , for now it is mainly used during development.

* It seems RESTful + Hypermedia API is the top priority for EWF.
