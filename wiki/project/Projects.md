# Libraries

## Hypermedia API library to work with XHTML 
* _Suggested by **Javier**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Use XHTML as a media type to for hypermedia API. See [http://codeartisan.blogspot.com.ar/2012/07/using-html-as-media-type-for-your-api.html](http://codeartisan.blogspot.com.ar/2012/07/using-html-as-media-type-for-your-api.html)

## Add support for Mediatype such as RSS, ATOM, ...
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: In addition to JSON, HAL, Collection+JSON, XHTML, application might want to support (read and write) standard media type such as RSS, ATOM, ...

## Security: provide popular authentication mechanisms
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Any web service, web site, API need a reliable authentication mechanism, the could be on the server side or the client side to build mashup service (integrate with other web API such as google, flicker, ...). So far, EWF provides only basic HTTP Authorization, and application would need more solutions such as :
   - OAuth: consumer and provider
   - OpenID
   - Google Connect
   - Facebook Connect
* The goal is to provide component to consume other popular API/service, but also component for your own service so that other can consume it.

## Provide a SSO (Single Sign On) implementation (server, and clients)
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Design and build a Single Sign On implementation for Eiffel. That should include the authentication server, and at least one Eiffel client component (it would be convenient to also provide php, js, ...). In the same spirit, having Eiffel client for popular SSO server would be appreciated as well.

    - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_single_sign-on_implementations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_single_sign-on_implementations)

## library: Template engine
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Get inspired by any existing template engine, and build one for Eiffel, this should be easily usable within a web application. This could be inspired, or implementation of standard template engine, this way people can reuse existing content, or migrate easily their application to EWF. For inspiration, one can look at:
  - [http://www.smarty.net/](http://www.smarty.net/)
  - [http://mustache.github.com/](http://mustache.github.com/)
  - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) ... they are plenty of them, a comparison of the different engine would help.
* This is not specific to EWF, but it will be very useful in website context.

## library: Wikitext, markdown parser and render engine
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Build component to support (read and write, and why not convert), lightweight markup language (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language)) such as wikitext, markdown, and other. The component should be able to read/scan, but also produce an HTML output. Focus first on wikitext, and markdown since they seems to be the most popular.
* Then , a nice addition would be to render those lightweight markup lang into Vision2 widget (not related to EWF, but could be useful to build (editor) desktop application)

## library: Web component to build HTML5 widget
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Build set of Eiffel components to ease development of websites. First this should be based on HTML5. Idea for components:
  - table widget (with sorting ...)
  - suggestive typing widget
  - tab ...
  - WYSIWYG textarea widget (could reuse existing Javascript solution TinyMCE, CKEditor, OpenWysiwyg,ï»¿ ...)
  - ...

## Add SSL support to Eiffel Net
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Currently Eiffel Net does not provide any support to SSL (thus no HTTPS). For now Eiffel application often use the Eiffel cURL wrapper which provide SSL, but it would be more convenient to use directly Eiffel Net. Then find solution to add SSL support to EiffelNet, or to extend EiffelNet with an EiffelNet+OpenSSL solution, or other.

## Build clients to consume popular RESTful APIs 
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn & Javier**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO 
* _Description_: Build Eiffel libraries to consume popular web APIs, such as:
   - Google Discovery APIs
   - Twitter
   - Facebook
   - Github
   - Flickr
   - ... etc
* This should reuse and improve the "http_client" provided by EWF. Eventually also write the EiffelNet implementation to be independant from cURL
* **Requirement**: OAuth client eiffel component

## Build a ESI preprocessor, or proxy
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* _Supervisor_:  
* _Suitability_: TODO
