(See [Full commit log](./doc/CommitLog) for all changes.)

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `jwt`: new JSON Web Token (JWT) library (supports for claim exp, iat, nbf, iss, aud).
- `http_client`: added support for ciphers setting in the libcurl implementation only.
- `http_client`: added convenient `get`  and `custom` functions  on HTTP_CLIENT directly.
- `websocket`: added `on_timer` solution to allow the server to check for external events and send notification to websocket clients.

### Changed
- adopted ecf version 1-16-0 and use a single .ecf file (the -safe.ecf are now redirection to normal .ecf)
### Deprecated
- removed support for Eiffel version before 17.05 .
- SSL 2 or 3 is obsolete and will raise an exception if used.
### Removed
### Fixed
- Removed a few obsolete calls.
- `http_client`: Added support for multiple file in form data. Made clear what is the meaning of `upload_filename`, `upload_data` and `form_data`.
- `authentication`: HTTP_AUTHORIZATION acceps now READABLE_STRING_GENERAL for username and password argument.
- `http_client`: fixed curl implementation by setting `Content-Type` to `x-www-form-urlencoded` (if not set) when POST send data as `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
### Security


## [v1.0.5] - 2017-05-17
### Changed
- http_network:
	Integrated changes on SOCKET so that EiffelWeb can be compiled with 16.05 to 17.05 and after.
### Fixed
- http_client:
	Improved query and form data encoding (based on a very early version of the general URI percent-encoding rules).
      - now correct encoding of space by '%20' in path segment, and '+' in query parameters.
    Unify and fixed query parameters handling for libcurl and net implementation.
    Fixed file uploading (various issue in libcurl, and net implementation).
    Fixed form multipart encoding by using correctly the boundary.
- Code cleaning:
	Removed many obsolete calls, and added timestamp on EiffelWeb obsolete features to benefit from upcoming improvement on the EiffelStudio Inspector tool.

## [v1.0.4] - 2017-03-15

### Added
- http_client: 
	Allow forcing multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded to choose how the form data should be sent.

- HTTP_HEADER: Added put_content_type_utf_8_text_html to HTTP_HEADER . 

- notification_email:
	Improved NOTIFICATION_SMTP_MAILER.make (..) to support user:password@...
	Propage error in notification_chain_mailer.

- Documentation: 
	added section for wsf_html library
	added README files to the examples.

- wsf_html: Added a few html widgets.

- examples: Added an example demonstrating the WSF_FORM component from `wsf_html` library.

### Changed
- WSF_FILE_SYSTEM_HANDLER: Improved the directory index access denied message.

- Documentation/website: 
	Updated documentation to match current source code.
	Moved website from gh-pages branch to /docs folder on master branch.
	Added section for wsf_html library.

- Examples:
	updated, cleaned and improved the `restbucks_CRUD` example.
	reorganized the examples folder.

### Fixed
- httpd and standalone connector:
	Updated code related to force_single_threaded setting to mark it obsolete, and for now, have coherent value 1 vs 0 among the standalone code and the httpd library.

- http_client (EiffelNet implementation):
	Fixed to follow redirection only for redirection http status 3** .

	Fixed http_client EiffelNet implementation when port is not the default one.  - previously the client was not sending the complete `host:port` but only `host` as `host` http header.

- WSF_REQUEST@wsf:
	If PATH_INFO is "/", the percent encoded path info is also "/". No need for complex computation. Note this fixes an issue with libfcgi app not hosted as root url such as "/sub/app.fcgi" on (old) IIS server.

	If PATH_INFO is empty, the percent encoded path info is also empty. No need for complex computation. Note this fixes an issue with libfcgi app not hosted as root url such as "/sub/app.fcgi".

## Day - 2016-10-05  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

	Updated `has_incoming_data` comment.

	Make EiffelWeb standalone easier to debug by using in some locations error instead of exception for network error. - Added C external to use C `recv` feature with error (as opposed to have exception raised on network error).

	Commented the execute_bad_request, since it is not ready and will trigger error most of the time.

## Day - 2016-10-04  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

	Improve socket management for EiffelWeb standalone connector.

	First attempt to response with bad request message when bad request is detected.

	Fixed SSL support on the httpd component, and also on the EiffelWeb standalone connector.   - the standalone connector support for SSL, is using certicate files for now (no in-memory support).   - to enable ssl support, set ecf variable `httpd_ssl_enabled=true`.   - added the `simple_ssl` example to demonstrate how to have standalone ssl server.     (be careful when using EiffelNet SSL and the http_client library, disable the libcurl       via ecf variable `libcurl_http_client_disabled=true` )
	Added support for recv timeout to the EiffelWeb standalone connector.
	  - made EiffelWeb compilable with 16.05 and upcoming 16.11.
	    Done via ecfs condition on version to accept EiffelNet with recv_timeout (from 16.11), and without (until 16.05).
	  - adding recv timeout prevents server to hang for ever if a client wait too long to send data.

	Updated various comments.

## Day - 2016-09-26  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

	First step towards SSL support.

## Day - 2016-08-05  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

	Added a simple reverse proxy handler. - For now, it does not support SSL connection on the target yet. - No external config file support, this is all about coding.

	Revisited WSF_REQUEST.read_input_data* functions: - read_input_data_into_file now accepts a IO_MEDIUM argument instead of just FILE. - cleaned the implementation, and make sure that eventual `raw_input_data` is containing only the raw input data.

	Ignore empty header line.

## Day - 2016-06-24  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

Add access to the socket of standalone input stream from `{WSF_STANDALONE_CONNECTOR_ACCESS}`. Removed a useless redefination in `WSF_EXECUTION`.

## Day - 2016-06-16  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

	Fixed signature of `{HTTPD_CONFIGURATION_I}.set_ca_key` .

	Make it easier to reuse the http network classes. This is to make it easier for websocket solution to reuse httpd implementation.

## Day - 2013-06-12  Jocelyn Fiat  <git@djoce.net>

	Better support for unicode path and values.
	Added WSF_REQUEST.percent_encoded_path_info: READABLE_STRING_8
	    to keep url encoded path info, as it is useful for specific component

	The router is now using WSF_REQUEST.percent_encoded_path_info
	    since URI_TEMPLATE are handling URI (and not IRI)
	    this fixes an issue with unicode path parameters.

	This should not break existing code, and this fixes various unicode related issues related
	   to PATH parameter and path info
	   but also any component using file names.

	(required EiffelStudio >= 7.2)

	Socket: reuse address to resolve the error "address already in use"

## Day - 2013-05-29  Olivier Ligot  <oligot@gmail.com>

	Socket: reuse address to resolve the error "address already in use"
	On Unix, when we stop the server, and then re-start it right away, we get an
	error that the address is already in use:
	http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/unix-socket-faq/unix-socket-faq-4.html#ss4.1
	This means that the sockets that were used by the first incarnation of the
	server are still active.

	One way to resolve this is to set the socket option SO_REUSEADDR:
	http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/unix-socket-faq/unix-socket-faq-4.html#ss4.5

	Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

	Display suggestion is now configurable

## Day - 2013-05-17  Olivier Ligot  <oligot@gmail.com>

	Display suggestion is now configurable.
	Commit 665772bda213e838b3c092075a386ee3b846b0be forces to display only
	suggestion for the request's method (this was not the case before).

	This commit allows to configure this behaviour: it keeps the current behaviour
	but also allows to use the other behaviour where the suggestion is displayed
	for each request method (as it was before).

	Merge pull request #26 from oligot/no-context
	Use execution_variable instead of context

## Day - 2013-01-23  Olivier Ligot  <oligot@gmail.com>

	Use execution_variable instead of context
	This is mainly to be compatibe with other classes API.

	In a lot of classes, we define methods like this:
	```Eiffel
	 method (req: WSF_REQUEST; res: WSF_RESPONSE)
	    do
	        ...
	    end
	```

	With the context, the signature becomes:
	```Eiffel
	 method (ctx: C; req: WSF_REQUEST; res: WSF_RESPONSE)
	    do
	        ...
	    end
	```

	So, I can't build a filter chain where one filter is with context
	and one is without context (I can't call
	WSF_FILTER.set_next (a_next: WSF_FILTER) with a filter that is a
	descendant of WSF_CONTEXT_HANDLER).

	Moreover, having to play with generic types just to pass some
	data from one filter to another is a bit overkill imho.
	Because this is really what I use contexts for:
	to pass data from one filter to the next one.

	Regarding execution_variable and strong typing, if we want to achieve these,
	I realize we could write a class with one getter and one setter like this:

	```Eiffel
	  class
	    TYPED_DATA

	  feature -- Access

	  user (req: WSF_REQUEST): detachable USER
	    do
	        if attached {USER} req.execution_variable ("user") as l_user then
	            Result := l_user
	        end
	    end

	  feature -- Element change

	  set_user (req: WSF_REQUEST; a_user: USER)
	    do
	        req.set_execution_variable ("user", a_user)
	    end
	```

	Now, I realize this is a major change since the last time we talked about this,
	but at the end, after having played with both, I prefer the one with
	execution_variable.

	Added a few library_target to .ecf to be able to build the tests/all-safe.ecf that enables us to check quickly the compilation state of EWF, and also perform refactorying over many projects.

	Fixed WSF_TRACE_RESPONSE which was overwritting previously prepared content.

	Breaking changes:  added `a_request_methods' argument to WSF_ROUTER_SELF_DOCUMENTATION_HANDLER.mapping_documentation  added similar argument to WSF_ROUTER_SELF_DOCUMENTATION_ROUTER_MAPPING.documentation Renamed WSF_ROUTER_METHODS as WSF_REQUEST_METHODS Enhanced WSF_REQUEST_METHODS with new has_... function Added WSF_ROUTER_VISITOR and WSF_ROUTER_ITERATOR that may be useful to iterate inside the router.    we may improve the implementation of the router using those visitors in the future. Improved the WSF_DEFAULT_RESPONSE to embedded suggested items (typically based on pseudo self documented router)

	Updated documentation output

	Fixed issue in WSF_REQUEST.read_input_data_into when the content is zero Cleaned the WGI_CHUNKED_INPUT_STREAM and provides access to last extension, last trailer, ... Improved WSF_TRACE_RESPONSE to support tracing chunked input back to the client.

	Fixed WSF_RESPONSE chunk transfer implementation   and also the optional extension `a_ext' should now include the ';' Now HTTP_HEADER is an ITERABLE [READABLE_STRING_8]

	changed UUID since this is the same a restbuckCRUD example.

	Fixed various assertions. Improved autotests Added target 'server' to be able to run the server outside the test process.

## Day - 2012-12-18  Jocelyn Fiat  <jfiat@eiffel.com>

	Fixed reading chunked input data When retrieving data block by block, use 8_192 instead of 1_024 (since 1_024 is too small most of the time)

	Fixed sending of chunk, especially the ending where there is an optional Trailer, and a mandatory final CRLF Now put_chunk does not support anymore empty chunk, and thus does not call put_chunk_end if ever it is called with empty chunk content. Fixed the `transfered_content_length' when dealing with chunk transfert encoding

	Added logger response wrapper, this is mainly to be able to save any response message to a file. (debugging purpose)

	Added basic support for "Expect" http header i.e:   WSF_REQUEST.http_expect: detachable READABLE_STRING_8

## Day - 2012-05-14  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	removed commented lines

	updated ChangeLog

	Rather use (READABLE_)STRING_GENERAL for argument instead of _8 or _32 variant Better design to set the WSF_REQUEST.path_parameters    especially handle the case where the request goes trought more than one route (could be the case when using WSF_ROUTING_HANDLER)

	Updated URI Template to follow official RFC6570

## Day - 2012-05-07  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Reviewed WSF_REQUEST.item (..) and items  to look into Form, Query, and Path (cookie are excluded for security) Added WSF_REQUEST.path_parameter (a_name): detachable WSF_VALUE    - fill path_parameters using `import_raw_path_parameters"      when executing the route    - reset to previous value with reset_path_parameters (..),      just in case the request is executed via severals routes.

## Day - 2012-05-04  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Reverted back to export upload_data and upload_filename to ANY (and related features)

	Removed HTTP_CLIENT_SESSION.post_multipart .. because it was not doing what the name might evoque Restrict export of HTTP_CLIENT_REQUEST_CONTEXT.upload_data and upload_filename (and related) to .._SESSION and .._REQUEST    this is mainly internal data, and is more about implementation than interface

	Now the http_client will send the form parameters urlencoded if this is possible (instead of multipart form data)
	Note for now, the library does not support sending file and form parameters at the same time.

## Day - 2012-05-03  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Fixed typo in .ecf .. curl instead of cURL

	Added geant scripts to compile EWF

	Improved the libcurl implementation of http_client by adding HTTP_CLIENT_SESSION.is_debug: BOOLEAN    if True, this display verbose debug information in console Implemented uploading of file for PUT and POST requests Refactored LIBCURL_HTTP_CLIENT_REQUEST to free used pointer, and also ease extension of the class if needed. Updated cURL library with addition of {CURL_EXTERNALS}.slist_free_all (..)

## Day - 2012-05-02  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	do not use implicit conversion from HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE

	Fixed wrong signature should be READABLE_STRING_32 instead of _8

	Also removing the implicit conversion from STRING to HTTP_*_TYPE

	Removed implicit conversion from HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE to STRING_8   because it could be a source of bug due to hidden conversion (and parameters) Applied changes to autotest cases Cosmetic

## Day - 2012-04-30  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Added comments Added `url' to compute the url from base_url, path and query parameters

	Fixed error in URL encoding, according to the RFC3986, space should not be encoded with '+' but with percent encoding.

	Fixed signature issue, the argument `name' should be READABLE_STRING_32

	Code cleaning

	Added specific helper function related to `charset' parameter

## Day - 2012-04-27  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	added postcondition status_reason_phrase_unset  to `set_status'

	cosmetic

## Day - 2012-04-13  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Fixed a last minute regression due to removal REQUEST.chunked_input

	Added WSF_ROUTER.pre_route_execution_actions: ACTION_SEQUENCE [like route] This way, one can add logger hook to router, to see which "route" was taken by the request.

	Made WGI_CHUNKED_INPUT_STREAM inherits from WGI_INPUT_STREAM Merged REQUEST.input and REQUEST.chunked_input   Now REQUEST.input handles directly the chunked transfer encoding, or the non chunked. Kept REQUEST.is_chunked_input since it matters that Content-Length is 0 even if there are input (chunked) data.

## Day - 2012-04-12  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Fixed compilation of samples

	Fixed compilation

	Missing commit related to changes on WSF_ROUTER

## Day - 2012-04-12  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Now WGI_RESPONSE.set_status_code (..) has a new argument to pass optional custom reason phrase.    This is a minor breaking change (but prior to the first release, so acceptable)    And then it is now possible to precise a custom reason phrase (useful for 4xx and 5xx response)
	At the WSF_RESPONSE level, the status code is now sent only when the header are sent.
	thus, it is possible to change the status code as long as no header is sent.
	(in the future, we should also try to delay the sending of headers)

	Removed WGI_RESPONSE.put_header_lines (..) which was not used, and WGI is not meant to provide such user friendly features
	Now this is available directly on WSF_RESPONSE

## Day - 2012-04-06  Jocelyn Fiat  <github@djoce.net>

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:EiffelWebFramework/EWF

	updated to EiffelWebFramework/EWF

	sync with json lib.

	Relaxed WSF_REDIRECTION_RESPONSE.set_content (.., ..) to allow Void for content type in order to use the one set in header or the default one.

	Removed default handler for WSF_ROUTER Added 	WSF_ROUTE to replace a TUPLE [H, C] 	WSF_ROUTER.route (req): detachable WSF_ROUTE 	WSF_ROUTER.execute_route (a_route, req, res) 	To help usage of Routers Remove WSF_HANDLER_CONTEXT obsolete features. Added comments

Rename EWSGI_RESPONSE into EWSGI_RESPONSE_BUFFER Added in extra/response-as-result/  an copy/paste from the implementation of Paul's proposal (not up to date with Paul's spec). But this is mainly for information and tests. Removed part of the ewsgi/specification interfaces ... to be able to test EWSGI compliant library against the pure specification (experimental). Renamed most of the GW_... into EWSGI_...

	removed the notion of status from GW_HEADER, since it should not be part of the HTTP header added status setting in GW_RESPONSE added a default implementation for write_status in OUTPUT_STREAM   (it should be moved away in the future) removed any implementation from GW_REQUEST, and put it in GW_REQUEST_IMP

## Day - 2011-07-26  Jocelyn Fiat  <jfiat@eiffel.com>

## Day - 2011-07-20  Jocelyn Fiat  <jfiat@eiffel.com>

	added use of URL-encoder to unencode the URL values (to fill the parameters) review design of GW_RESPONSE to hide the output, and remove the header attribute added script_url in REQUEST to help the user build url relative to script_name
	+ cosmetic

	First version of URI Template library as specified by http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-05 (it seems to contains some error in the spec .. or minor incoherences, to double check) The matcher is basic, it does not handle all the details of the string builder, but that seems ok for now.

## Day - 2011-07-18  Jocelyn Fiat  <jfiat@eiffel.com>

	fixed submodule path ... Windows path separator issue..

## Day - 2011-07-12  Jocelyn Fiat  <jfiat@eiffel.com>

	added instruction to get the source code

	First integration of the new GW_ design more centralized on connector, and does not require specific feature on GW_APPLICATION depending on the connector. So this is really more flexible this way, and much easier to write application supporting CGI, FCGI, Nino and so on .. as demonstrated in hello_world
	This is a first version, more will come later, mainly migrating from Eiffel Web Reloaded to this Eiffel Web Framework project.
