Welcome to the EiffelWeb framework documentation.

The EiffelWeb framework is also known as *EWF*.

The [Workbook](/docs/workbook/workbook.md) lets you discover the EiffelWeb framework.

And you may found in the *old* [Wiki](/docs/wiki/readme.md) notes that were not migrated to the [Workbook](/docs/workbook/workbook.md), but consider them as obsolete.
