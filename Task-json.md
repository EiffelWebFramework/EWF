## Goal ##
- Make this JSON library the default one for the community

## Steps ##
- restructure to follow the (doc,library,test,...) structure
- extract gobo from it, and provide json.ecf, json-safe.ecf, json_with_gobo.ecf (and json_with_gobo-safe.ecf : not possible right now, but we can _cheat_)
- and then let Eiffel Software include it, in the official libraries

## Roadmap ##
- this should be done before 1st of October
