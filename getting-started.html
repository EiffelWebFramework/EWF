            <h1>Getting Started</h1>
          </div>
          <p>This page will help you to get started with EWF.
          We will first see how to install EWF and then how to compile and run the venerable <i>Hello World</i> example.</p>
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <h3>EiffelStudio 7.2</h3>
          <p>EWF is already included in EiffelStudio 7.2: you don't have to do anything in this case!
          This is the recommanded solution if you are a new developer or are new to Eiffel.</p>
          <h3>Other EiffelStudio versions</h3>
          <p>If you have another version of EiffelStudio than 7.2, you have to</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF/archive/v0.3.1.zip">dowload EWF</a></li>
            <li>create a directory where you will put your custum Eiffel libraries</li>
            <li>extract EWF in the newly created directory</li>
            <li>define the environment variable EIFFEL_LIBRARY to point to the newly created directory</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Source code</h3>
          <p>The source code is available on Github.
          You can get it by running the command:</p>
          <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF.git</code></pre>
          <h2>Hello World</h2>
          <p>The hello world example is located in the directory <i>$ISE_EIFFEL/contrib/examples/web/ewf/simple</i>.
          Just double click on the <i>simple.ecf</i> file and select the <i>simple</i> target or if you prefer the command line, run the command:</p>
          <pre><code>estudio -config simple.ecf -target simple</code></pre>
          <p>Once the project is compiled, we will adapt the root class to point to port number 9090.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-info">
          <strong>Note</strong>: By default, the application listens on port 80, which is often already used by standard webservers (Apache, nginx, ...).
          Moreover, on Linux, ports below 1024 can only be opened by root.
          </div>
          <p>To do this, we will redefine the feature <i>initialize</i> as follows:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-eiffel">
class
	APPLICATION

inherit
	WSF_DEFAULT_SERVICE
		redefine
			initialize
		end

create
	make_and_launch

feature {NONE} -- Initialization

	initialize
			-- Initialize current service
		do
			set_service_option ("port", 9090)
		end
          </pre>
          <p>After one more compile, you can now launch the application and point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:9090">http://localhost:9090</a>.
          You should now see a simple page with <i>Hello World</i>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
